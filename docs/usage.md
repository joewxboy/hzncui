#Using Open Horizon CUI

From the folder where the project was built, run `hzncui`.  This will create the UI in your terminal.  You will see context-sensitive instructions on the status line at the bottom of the screen.

## Pre-requisites

You must have the following environment variables set to valid values before running `hzncui`:

* `HZN_ORG_ID`
* `EXCHANGE_USER_ADMIN_PW`
* `HZN_EXCHANGE_URL`
